# Wheat-Kernal-Classification

## Objective
On a wheat seed dataset obtained from Kaggle, uploaded in the repository as well with name 'seeds.csv' having seven features for three different types of wheat kernels (Kama, Rosa, Canadian), we used EDA because it allows us to see the data's core structure, patterns, and relationships and to figure out which features to use to categorize the wheat kernels.
Then we build a classifier model to categorize the wheat kernels. We used plain machine learning classifiers and ensemble models to predict the type of wheat kernel based on the independent variables provide. Finally, developed a hyper tuned model to produce the best accuracy for the classification task at hand.

### Benefits for the end user:
•	Help in predicting the wheat kernel based on the values of the attributes provided.

## Data Set
This data was obtained from Kaggle.
It has seven numerical variables for three different types of wheat kernels (Kama, Rosa, and Canadian), which are labelled 1, 2, and 3 accordingly.
The following are the seven seed variables:
1.	Area
2.	Perimeter
3.	Compactness
4.	Kernel Length
5.	Kernel Width
6.	Asymmetry Coefficient
7.	Kernel Groove Length

## Tasks performed in the 'Wheat Kernal Classification' Jupyter notebook
•	Data Collection
•	Finding the right algorithms and its understanding
•	Preparing the model using the algorithms
•	Model Training and its evaluation
•	Hyperparameter Tuning
•	Model accuracy evaluation
•	Final model deployment


## How can this repository be used on your system
•	Fork the repo onto your local
•	Run the jupyter notebook, follow the steps alongside
•	Rub the final model and save it as pickle file to call it in the FlaskApp.py file
•	The html file and the css files can be changed as per user requirements else can be used as default
•	Run the FlaskApp.py file to get it running onto your local machine
Input your attribute values
And, woah!, you get the Prediction, as shown below.
